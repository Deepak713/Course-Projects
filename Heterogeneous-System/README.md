# Real-Time QoS-Aware Vehicle Tracking: An Experimental and Comparative Study
Recently, web service became popular for Real-time Communication (RTC). It allows bi-directional, real-time communication between web clients and server. On the other hand, Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware offers unified integration with high-performance due to its scalability, flexibility, real-time, mission-critical networks and rich QoS features. DDS is based on the publish/subscribe communication model. It improves RTC through its efficient and high-performance data delivery mechanism. This paper studies and investigates that how DDS is better for RTC. Experimental studies are conducted to compare text messaging using socket IO over DDS Web API. The result concerns the throughput satisfaction rate, round trip time and packet loss. In addition, we consider some of QoS of DDS during experimental work e.g. deadline, time based filter etc.
